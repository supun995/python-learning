ðŸ”€ Parallelism with Threads vs AsyncIO in Python
Concept	Threads (parallelism)	AsyncIO (concurrency)
Type	Preemptive parallelism	Cooperative concurrency
Execution	Multiple threads run in parallel (simulated in CPython)	One thread runs multiple tasks by switching between them
Switching	Done by OS scheduler	Done by Python (manually via await)
Best for	CPU-bound & blocking I/O	I/O-bound (like HTTP, DB, etc.)
Requires	threading module	asyncio + async/await syntax
Overhead	Higher (threads are heavier)	Lower (no real threads)
Thread-safe?	Needs locks for shared data	Generally single-threaded, safer

Threads (Parallelism)
Simulate real parallel execution

Python threads are limited by the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock), so they donâ€™t speed up CPU-bound tasks.

But theyâ€™re great for parallel I/O â€” like downloading files.

AsyncIO (Concurrency)
Runs multiple tasks in a single thread using await to pause and resume functions.

Great for non-blocking I/O.

Not useful for CPU-bound tasks unless combined with threads or processes.

import asyncio


async def task():
    print("Start")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    print("End")


async def main():
    await asyncio.gather(task(), task())


asyncio.run(main())

#Both tasks start immediately and await the sleep â€” they concurrently share the thread.

Threads:

|-----Task 1-----|
|-----Task 2-----|
(Parallel lines)
AsyncIO:

|-Task 1-|   |-Task 1 resume-|
    |-Task 2-|   |-Task 2 resume-|
(Switches between)
