"""
Exceptions are a part of the development process. The pdb module includes a feature called post mortem debugging. When debugged applications raise unhandled exceptions the debugger automatically enters post mortem debugging mode.

Post mortem debugging allows developers to inspect the state of an application at the time it crashed.
